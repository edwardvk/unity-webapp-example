		var numMessages = 3;			// unread message count
		var numClicks = 0;			// in-page clicks

			// browser window to the appropriate page (e.g. when
			// they follow a quicklink from the launcher or
			// the inbox in the messaging menu).
			window.location = mainsite + strWhere + ".html";

		// Instantiate the Unity integration object.  This has to be
		// done before we can actually do anything.  The "1.0" is the
		// version of the Unity object we want to use (as of the time
		// of writing, 1.0 is the most up-to-date).
		var Unity = external.getUnityObject(1.0);

		// Now initialize the Unity object.  We give a couple of values
		// that are necessary to have a nice web app:
		//    name: the name that will be attached to the icon in the
		//        launcher and dash
		//    iconUrl: the URL of the image that will be used in the
		//        launcher and dash
		//    onInit: the function that will be called when the Unity
		//        object is ready to be used.  (More on this later.)

			name: "Example Web App",

			/***
			 * This is the function that was named as the "onInit"
			 * value when we initialized the Unity object above.
			 * It gets called when the object is ready to go.
			 * This is where you should put all of your setup code
			 * (such as adding a count to the launcher icon,
			 * integrating with menus, etc.)
			 *
			 * This is a bit of a 'gotcha': if you try to do any
			 * of this setup outside of this init function, it's
			 * likely to simply not work!  Make sure all your setup
			 * code is in here and not floating around elsewhere.
			 ***/

			// Let's start by integrating with the messaging menu.
			// In a real application you would want to call this
			// with dynamic data that applies to the logged-in user
			// (or not call it at all if the user is not logged in
			// to your application).  Here we're just giving it
			// a static number.
			// The "count" is simply the number that will show up
			// in the messaging menu.  The "callback" is a
			// Javascript callback that will be executed when this
			// item in the messaging menu is clicked.  (A callback
			// is basically a function that returns a function.  It
			// gets evaluated when this code is first run on init,
			// so we can't simply put what we want to get executed
			// here but instead create a function object that will
			// get called.  For this example, we'll use an instance
			// of the unityRedirect() function we created above that
			// directs the user to the "messages.html" page on the
			// site. 
			Unity.MessagingIndicator.showIndicator(
				"Inbox",
				{
					count: numMessages, 
					callback: function(){ unityRedirect("messages"); }
				});

			// Now let's set up the launcher icon.  For this
			// example, we will have a button on the page that
			// increments a counter on the launcher when it is
			// clicked.
			Unity.Launcher.setCount(numClicks);

			// Now this makes me a sad panda: as near as I can
			// tell, this *should* work.  It does add a quicklink
			// to the launcher, but clicking it does nothing.
			// The only comfort I take here is that none of the
			// included default webapps work either!  (E.g. the
			// Amazon integration included with Unity exhibits the
			// same behavior.)  I can only assume this is a bug in
			// the Unity web integration.
			Unity.Launcher.addAction("Messages",
				function(){ unityRedirect("messages"); } 
			);

			if (numClicks > 3)
